# CampusSpeak - Online Student Complaint & Feedback System
## A project by Group 1

## Project Overview
**CampusSpeak** is a web-based platform designed to empower college students to report issues and provide feedback to their institution, ensuring their voices are heard. Built with **Laravel** and **Blade** templating, styled with **Bootstrap**, it offers a user-friendly interface for submitting complaints (e.g., academic, facility, bullying) with an optional anonymous mode for sensitive issues. The system includes an admin dashboard for school staff to review and respond to submissions, with ticket tracking to keep students informed of their complaint status. CampusSpeak fosters transparent communication between students and administration, enhancing campus life.
